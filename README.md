## Description
GreenLoop is a sustainability-focused platform where you earn rewards for completing personalized tasks generated by Gemini AI. You can use these rewards to buy or sell recycled items in our marketplace, promoting reusability and reducing waste. By offering incentives for eco-friendly actions and promoting a circular economy, GreenLoop transforms your sustainable actions into valuable rewards, contributing to a greener future.\
You earn rewards in our in-app currency called `Ecobucks`.

## How We Use the Gemini AI API in GreenLoop

1. **Generate Daily Personalized Sustainable Actions**
   - The Gemini AI API analyzes your habits, preferences, and lifestyle to create personalized sustainable actions that you can easily integrate into your daily routine. These tasks are tailored to you, ensuring they are both impactful and manageable, helping you contribute to environmental sustainability in a way that fits your lifestyle.

2. **Verify Actions with an Image**
   - To ensure authenticity and encourage accountability, the Gemini AI API uses advanced image recognition to verify that the sustainable actions you perform are completed as intended. By submitting a photo of your action, Gemini AI verifies the action, allowing you to earn `Ecobucks` confidently.

3. **Generate Price of Recycled Goods**
   - The Gemini AI API also plays a crucial role in the marketplace by determining the value of recycled goods. It assesses various factors like the image, condition, and potential reuse value to generate fair and accurate prices in `Ecobucks` for items you wish to buy or sell. This dynamic pricing ensures that transactions are equitable and reflective of the environmental impact, fostering a fair and sustainable economy within GreenLoop.
